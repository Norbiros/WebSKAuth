**⚠️ I don't maintain WebSK and WebSKAuth. If you want to ask for help do it on WebSK discord! ⚠️**

Auth in Skript using WebSK plugin.

# How to install?
1. Copy file websk-auth.sk to your `Skript/scripts/` folder.
2. Install Skript addons `reqn` and `skript-json`
3. Copy all other html files to `WebSK/files/`
4. Get all data in Discord Developer Portal
5. Fill are options with values (auth client id, client secret, redirect uri, user agent (it should be `DiscordBot (<your domain>, v1.0)`), domain (your webpage domain/ip))
6. Add you auth link to `home.html`
7. Run code using `/skript reload websk-auth`

  **Code is WIP! Because WebSK uses HTTP it isn't 100% secure!**
